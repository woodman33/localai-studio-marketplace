## First Comment (Founder Introduction)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Will, and I built Local AI Studio because I was frustrated with:

1. **Privacy concerns** - Every chat sent to cloud AI services
2. **Subscription fatigue** - $20/month adds up fast
3. **Complexity** - Running local AI shouldn't require a PhD
4. **Ugly UIs** - Most local AI tools look like they're from 1995

Local AI Studio solves all of this with a beautiful, one-click interface for running AI models locally.

**What makes it special:**

🎨 **Design-first approach** - It should feel as good as ChatGPT
⚡ **One-click everything** - Browse, install, chat in seconds
🔒 **Privacy by default** - Your data never leaves your machine
💰 **Actually free** - No hidden costs, no subscriptions

**Current status:**
- 11 models available
- Real-time download progress
- Custom model switching
- Production-ready on Docker

**What's next:**
- API marketplace integration
- Multi-model conversations
- Model fine-tuning UI
- Plugin system

Try it at https://localai.studio or star us on GitHub!

Would love your feedback! What features do you want to see?

A: Yes, 100% free and open source. All models are open source too.

A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap! For now, focused on chat inference.
