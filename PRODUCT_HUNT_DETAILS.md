## ❓ FAQ PREP

Prepare answers for common questions:

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: 8GB RAM minimum (16GB+ recommended), modern CPU with AVX2, Docker installed, ~50GB disk space for all models.

**Q: Does it work on Mac/Windows/Linux?**
A: Yes! Works on all platforms via Docker. Docker Desktop required for Mac/Windows.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: Runs 100% locally, no internet required, complete privacy, no subscriptions, and you control everything.

**Q: Can I use my own models?**
A: Yes! Any Ollama-compatible model can be added.

**Q: Is it really unlimited?**
A: Yes - one-time purchase, use forever with no restrictions.

**Q: What's the performance like?**
A: Depends on your hardware. TinyLlama is near-instant. Larger models (70B) need beefy hardware but run well on M2 Max Macs or high-end PCs.
